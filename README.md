## Background

The objective of this project is to determine the potential success of opening a Surf and Ice Cream Shop in Oahu, HI. My role in this project is to determine temperature trends before opening the Shop, specifically looking at the months of June and December, in order to see if a Surf Shop is sustainable there year round.

## Results

Using the data gathered regarding temperatures in June and December there are three reasonable conclusions one can make about the weather Hawaii:

* The difference between the mean temperatures is only 5 degrees. Which is an indicator that weather does not fluctuate very much between seasons.

* The minimum temperatures in June and December are 10 degrees and 15 degrees lower than the mean, respectively. Which indicates that December will on somedays be considerably colder than June in some instances.

* The maximum temperatures are only 2 degrees different in each month. Which indicates that there is no month that will have considerably higher heat.
